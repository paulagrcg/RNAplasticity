## Next Steps

1. Take into account the `seqstarget` as the sequences which have both phenos as the heaviest weight with respect to others.
2. Define TF from another random point in the GP map.
3. Consider doing another pair instead of just 130. Determine the criteria for selecting pairs.
4. Compare the abundance of orange + green vs. axis + noise regimes. Analyze the boundary between them using the variables axis, mu, and delta t. Plot the regimes.
5. Delete all unnecessary data and keep only the means.
6. Include standard errors in the regime plot.
