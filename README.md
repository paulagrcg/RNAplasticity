# RNA plasticity 
- Data: 
(per generation)
seqscommon : plastic genotypes abundance 
extreme0 : genotypes with only target 0
extreme1: genotypes with only target 1 
other: rest of gentoypes, noise. 
meanfitness: mean fitness of the population
meanprobs0: population mean of Boltzmann probability on target 0
meanprobs1: population mean of Boltzmann probability on target 1

(ignore seqstarget, meanprobs0seqscom, meanprobs1seqscom, and alphalist)
